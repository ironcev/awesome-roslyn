## Books
Awesome books to give you a good start with Roslyn.

- [Roslyn Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/roslyn) - *Free e-book* by Alessandro Del Sole and the perfect book to start with. Explains Roslyn APIs and afterward focuses on writing analyzers and refactorings.
- [.NET Development Using the Compiler API](https://www.apress.com/la/book/9781484221105) - Book by Jason Bock. Besides analyzers and refactorings, it also explains the scripting API and provides an interesting reflection on the future of the Compiler API.
- [Roslyn Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/roslyn-cookbook) - Book by Manish Vasani, a member of the Roslyn analyzers team. After covering analyzers, refactorings, and scripting in detail, the book goes in-depth explaining how to develop new C# language features and contribute to the Roslyn source code.

## Tutorials
Awesome online tutorials to help you write your first analyzers and code fixes.

- [Learn Roslyn Now](https://joshvarty.com/learn-roslyn-now/) - Series of blog posts that explore the Roslyn compiler API. It introduces the power of Roslyn through small self-contained examples. A perfect tutorial to start with :-)
