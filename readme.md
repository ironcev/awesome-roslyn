- [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) - Enables a cross platform .NET development in the editor of your choice. A family of open source projects, each with one goal: To enable a great .NET experience in your editor of choice.
- [roslyn-linq-rewrite](https://github.com/antiufo/roslyn-linq-rewrite) - Compiles C# code by first rewriting the syntax trees of LINQ expressions using plain procedural code. This increases performance by minimizes heap allocations and dynamic dispatch.
- [RoslynPad](https://roslynpad.net/) - A cross-platform C# editor. Features code completion, method signature help, quick fixes, and diagnostics.
- [RoslynQuoter](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/RoslynQuoter) - A tool that for a given C# program generates syntax tree API calls that construct the syntax tree of that program.
- [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) - Turns C# into a powerful scripting tool. Features C# REPL, installation of NuGet packages, execution of scripts with a single line of code.
- [Scripty](https://github.com/daveaglick/Scripty) - Tools to let you use Roslyn-powered C# scripts for code generation.
- [Sharpen](http://sharpen.rocks) - A Visual Studio extension that intelligently introduces new C# language features into your existing code base.
- [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/) - .NET code playground. Displays intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Shows the code as compiler sees it. Allows selecting different branches and versions of Roslyn. Runs C#, VB.NET, and F# code in the browser.
- [Testura.Code](https://github.com/Testura/Testura.Code) - A wrapper around the Roslyn API used for generation, saving and compiling C# code. Provides methods and helpers to generate classes, methods, statements and expressions.
